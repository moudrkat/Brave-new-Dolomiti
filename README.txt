The aim of this project is to train a model capable of generating new Dolomiti landscapes, in honor of the author of thousands of stunning photographs used for training.
I am currently working on implementing DCGAN and WGAN, and later, I plan to explore the VQGAN approach as well.
Hopefully, one of these methods will converge successfully.

Run with argument: streamlit run app_train_model.py -- --model DCGAN

Currently only DCGAN model works ... soon WGAN will be implemented
